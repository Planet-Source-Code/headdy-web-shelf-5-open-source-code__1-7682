Web Shelf 5 Source Code - exclusive to Planet Source Code

-----------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for downloading this archive.
Web Shelf is a program that I have been aching to make, after I encountered an uncommon problem involving web graphics. There are many programs of this kind in the public domain, but the aim of this one was to be the best at its job. Therefore I have incorporated several features and plan many more for the next version.

This program takes your web graphics (those with the .gif, .jpg and .bmp extensions) and arranges them in a neat table inside a web page. There are options for the dimensions of this table, called a Web Shelf, fonts, information to display and to create thumnbailed images.

Web Shelf 5 is to be released by myself at my site as soon as I complete the help file, which will be in HTML Help. Unfortunately I have a problem with the HTML Help Workshop regarding a missing LTIRCL.DLL so this won't be anytime soon.
Why version 5? Because the previous 4 versions were too basic to release, were never completed and I no longer have the source code for them.

This source code has been sent to Planet Source Code not only because it's the best resource for Visual Basic code, but also I want to encourage people to tweak this program as much as possible. Therefore I have decided that Web Shelf 5 will be open source.

I have spent considerable time commenting everything so that you can understand what's going on and how messy my source code can really be. It's helpful for those who are just beginning VB. More of you should do this too!

You are free to make any modifications you want to the program, but please stick to the following rules...

- It's mandatory that you mention that I was the original creator of course, and that the derived program was originally called Web Shelf, although you can give it the name of your choice. It took me a matter of weeks, but at risk from failing A-levels, to produce this program.

- You must let me know if you plan to release your version, so that I can link to it and your site from mine.

- Send me an e-mail!

Anybody who wishes to help with making a help file is most welcome, as I am busy with my site.

Once again, thanks for investigating this Winzip file and thanks for showing interest in my source code. You are not obliged to nominate me for a prize.
